# IA

## Description

This Program does an infinite loop with espeak and the printwords "IA?" and "Bidde?"

Use it for several situations, especially, if you are really really sad.

Jawoll!

## NEW !!

Now with the incredible "-random" mode!
The Program can now print in random times, and some specials, the first one is the 30% possibility, that "IA" comes twice, and a 2% chance for a special print. Have Fun! :D

## Dependencies

Use it with an Linux OS and espeak
